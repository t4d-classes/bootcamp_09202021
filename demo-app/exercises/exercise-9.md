# Exercise 9

1. Add a new column to the Car Table. The column header should be set to "Actions".

2. On each row in the new column, add a Delete button. When the Delete button is clicked, delete the row from the table.

  **Hint:** To perform a delete in JavaScript, look at the array `filter` function.

```html
<footer>

</footer>
```

4. Display the Tool Footer at the bottom of Car Tool and Color Tool. Please make the Tool Footer component dynamic as appropriate.
